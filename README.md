# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

## üìä Project Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard for HR analytics, designed to analyze employee attrition trends, salary distribution, job roles, and other key HR metrics. The dashboard provides insights to help businesses understand employee retention and workforce trends.

## üìÅ Dataset
- **Filename:** HR_Analytics.csv
- **Source:** Internal HR records
- **Key Features:**
  - Employee demographic details (Age, Gender, Department, Education)
  - Job-related attributes (Job Role, Salary, Years at Company)
  - Attrition indicators

## üìà Dashboard Insights
The Power BI dashboard provides the following key insights:

### **Overall Statistics:**
- **Total Employees:** 1,470
- **Employees with Attrition:** 237
- **Attrition Rate:** 16.1%
- **Average Age:** 37 years
- **Average Salary:** 6.5K
- **Average Years at Company:** 7 years

### **Attrition Breakdown by Education**
- This graph shows the attrition rate across different education levels.
- The highest attrition rate (38%) is observed in employees from Life Sciences backgrounds, followed by Technical Degrees and Marketing.
- Understanding educational backgrounds can help in targeted retention strategies.

### **Attrition Breakdown by Age Group**
- Employees in the age range of **26-35 years** show the highest attrition (116 employees).
- Younger employees, specifically those between **18-25 years**, also show significant attrition.
- Retention strategies should focus on engaging and growing younger talent within the organization.

### **Attrition Breakdown by Salary Slab**
- The majority of employees leaving fall within the **‚â§5K salary bracket** (163 employees).
- Higher salary groups (10K-15K and 15K+) experience significantly lower attrition rates.
- This insight highlights the importance of competitive compensation structures.

### **Attrition Breakdown by Job Role**
- The **highest attrition** is observed among **Laboratory Technicians (62 employees)**, followed by **Sales Executives (57 employees)** and **Research Scientists (47 employees)**.
- Job roles that require specialized skills or have fewer career growth opportunities may experience higher attrition.
- This suggests a need for career development programs within these roles.

### **Attrition Breakdown by Years at Company**
- Employees with 0-5 years at the company experience the highest attrition rates.
- Retention rates improve after employees complete a certain tenure.
- Employee engagement and professional development programs can improve retention in early years.

### **Attrition Breakdown by Gender**
- The attrition rate among **male employees (150 employees)** is higher than that of **female employees (87 employees)**.
- This may indicate differences in job satisfaction, work-life balance, or industry-related factors affecting attrition.

### **Attrition Breakdown by Department**
- The most affected departments are **Sales, Research & Development (R&D), and Human Resources (HR)**.
- These departments should focus on policies to improve job satisfaction and reduce turnover.
